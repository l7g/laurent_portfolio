This project is not mine and is fully copied from a YT video (https://youtu.be/dImgZ_AH7uA?si=hgBDomioXm3AcUs0).
I used the video to refresh my skills while learning tailwind, on a side project as a uni student.
I used the video to have a solid base from where to start and create my own portfolio.

I do not intend to use this website for job search purposes, but solely as a good start point.
